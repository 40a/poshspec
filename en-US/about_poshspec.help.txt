SHORT DESCRIPTION
    A Infrastructure Testing DSL running in Pester.


LONG DESCRIPTION
    A Infrastructure Testing DSL running in Pester. The goal was to expand the Pester DSL to allow the development of 
    infrastructure validation scripts quickly.

PESTER
    This module augments the Pester testing framework. You can break up your tests into Describe and Context blocks as 
    you would with normal tests. PoshSpec helper functions will generate the It and statements and execute the Should 
    statements as you define.
    
    Every entry should have a ScriptBlock defining a Should assertion as you would in any Pester script.
    
    Eg.
    Service w32time { Should Be Running }
    
    See the help for individual Functions for more details about syntax and which Pester assertions to use.
